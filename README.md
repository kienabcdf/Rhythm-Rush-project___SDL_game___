#Introduction to the Project
Welcome to the Rhythm Rush project!


Rhythm Rush is a dynamic rhythm game developed using C++ programming language and utilizing the SDL library for building. The project is created by Tran Trung Kien - a student at the University of Technology, Vietnam National University, as part of an assignment in the course.

#Features:

Engaging rhythm-based gameplay with exciting challenges.

Multiple difficulty levels to challenge players.

Beautiful interface and immersive sound effects.

Automatic game saving feature to resume progress.

User-friendly menu interface for easy navigation.

Ability to pause the game for convenience.

#Knowledge Algorithms Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented OOP principles for managing game systems and the node data structure (inheritance and polymorphism).

Inheritance: Utilized inheritance for system management and organizing data structures within the game.

Multithreading: Employed multithreading to handle audio and visual effects separately for optimizing game performance.

Interactive Sound Effects: Integrated high-interaction sound effects using SDL's audio spatialization features, enhancing the player's experience.

Dynamic Image Effects: Implemented dynamic image effects by overlaying layers on textures and adjusting them using a time-based effect management system within the main loop.

File Handling for Game Saving: Utilized file handling techniques to implement automatic game saving, allowing players to resume their progress.

Preventing Key Sticking: Implemented methods to prevent key sticking issues during continuous program execution, ensuring smooth gameplay experience.
